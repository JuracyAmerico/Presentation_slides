Less is known about the impact of corticosteroid-sparing IBD therapies on pneumonia risk or the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination in reducing all-cause pneumonia in real-world IBD cohorts.We performed a population-based study using an established Veterans Health Administration cohort of 29,957 IBD patients. We identified all patients who developed bacterial pneumonia. Cox survival analysis was used to determine the association of corticosteroids at study entry and as a time-varying covariate, corticosteroid-sparing agents (immunomodulators and antitumor necrosis-alpha [TNF] inhibitors), and pneumococcal vaccination with the development of all-cause pneumonia.Patients with IBD who received corticosteroids had a greater risk of pneumonia when controlling for age, gender, and comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR] 2.21; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.90–2.57 for prior use; HR = 3.42; 95\% CI, 2.92–4.01 for use during follow-up). Anti-TNF inhibitors (HR 1.52; 95\% CI, 1.02–2.26), but not immunomodulators (HR 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.77–1.07), were associated with a small increase in pneumonia. A history of pneumonia was strongly associated with subsequent pneumonia (HR = 4.41; 95\% CI, 3.70–5.27). Less than 15\% of patients were vaccinated against pneumococcus, and this was not associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia (HR = 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.80–1.30) in this cohort.In a large US cohort, corticosteroids were confirmed to increase pneumonia risk. Tumor necrosis-alpha inhibitors were associated with a smaller increase in the risk of pneumonia. Surprisingly, pneumococcal vaccination did not reduce all-cause pneumonia in this population, though few patients were vaccinated.},

  abstract = {In the modern era, the consumption of antibiotics represents a revolutionary weapon against several infectious diseases, contributing to the saving of millions of lives worldwide. However, the misuse of antibiotics for human and animal purposes has fueled the process of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), considered now a global emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO), which significantly increases the mortality risk and related medical costs linked to the management of bacterial diseases. The current research aiming at developing novel efficient antibiotics is very challenging, and just a few candidates have been identified so far due to the difficulties connected with AMR. Therefore, novel therapeutic or prophylactic strategies to fight AMR are urgently needed. In this scenario, vaccines constitute a promising approach that proves to be crucial in preventing pathogen spreading in primary infections and in minimizing the usage of antibiotics following secondary bacterial infections. Unfortunately, most of the vaccines developed against the main resistant pathogens are still under preclinical and clinical evaluation due to the complexity of pathogens and technical difficulties. In this review, we describe not only the main causes of AMR and the role of vaccines in reducing the burden of infectious diseases, but we also report on specific prophylactic advancements against some of the main pathogens, focusing on new strategies that aim at improving vaccine efficiency.},

  abstract = {Approximately 50 000 influenza-associated deaths occur annually in the United States, overwhelmingly among individuals aged ≥65 years. Although vaccination is the primary prevention tool, investigations have shown low vaccine effectiveness (VE) in recent years, particularly among the elderly. We analyzed the relative VE (RVE) of all influenza vaccines among Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years to prevent influenza hospital encounters during the 2019–2020 season.Retrospective cohort study using Poisson regression and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Exposures included egg-based high-dose trivalent (HD-IIV3), egg-based adjuvanted trivalent (aIIV3), egg-based standard dose (SD) quadrivalent (IIV4), cell-based SD quadrivalent (cIIV4), and recombinant quadrivalent (RIV4) influenza vaccines.We studied 12.7 million vaccinated beneficiaries. Following IPTW, cohorts were well balanced for all covariates and health-seeking behavior indicators. In the adjusted analysis, RIV4 (RVE, 13.3\%; 95\% CI, 7.4–18.9\%), aIIV3 (RVE, 8.2\%; 95\% CI, 4.2–12.0\%), and HD-IIV3 (RVE, 6.8\%; 95\% CI, 3.3–10.1\%) were significantly more effective in preventing hospital encounters than the reference egg-based SD IIV4, while cIIV4 was not significantly more effective than IIV4 (RVE, 2.8\%; 95\% CI, −2.8\%, 8.2\%). Our results were consistent across all analyses.In this influenza B-Victoria and A(H1N1)–dominated season, RIV4 was moderately more effective than other vaccines, while HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 were more effective than the IIV4 vaccines, highlighting the contributions of antigen amount and adjuvant use to VE. Egg adaptation likely did not substantially affect our RVE evaluation. Our findings, specific to the 2019–2020 season, should be evaluated in other studies using virological case confirmation.},

  abstract = {Background As we continue the fourth year of the COVID-19 epidemic, SARS-CoV-2 infections still cause high morbidity and mortality in the United States. During 2020–2022, COVID-19 was one of the leading causes of death in the United States and by far the leading cause among infectious diseases. Vaccination uptake remains low despite this being an effective burden reducing intervention. The development of COVID-19 therapeutics provides hope for mitigating severe clinical outcomes. This modeling study examines combined strategies of vaccination and treatment to reduce the burden of COVID-19 epidemics over the next decade. Methods We use a validated mathematical model to evaluate the reduction of incident cases, hospitalized cases, and deaths in the United States through 2033 under various levels of vaccination and treatment coverage. We assume that future seasonal transmission patterns for COVID-19 will be similar to those of influenza virus and account for the waning of infection-induced immunity and vaccine-induced immunity in a future with stable COVID-19 dynamics. Due to uncertainty in the duration of immunity following vaccination or infection, we consider three exponentially distributed waning rates, with means of 365~days (1~year), 548~days (1.5~years), and 730~days (2~years). We also consider treatment failure, including rebound frequency, as a possible treatment outcome. Results As expected, universal vaccination is projected to eliminate transmission and mortality. Under current treatment coverage (13.7\%) and vaccination coverage (49\%), averages of 81,000–164,600 annual reported deaths, depending on duration of immunity, are expected by the end of this decade. Annual mortality in the United States can be reduced below 50,000 per year with 52–80\% annual vaccination coverage and below 10,000 annual deaths with 59–83\% annual vaccination coverage, depending on duration of immunity. Universal treatment reduces hospitalizations by 88.6\% and deaths by 93.1\% under current vaccination coverage. A reduction in vaccination coverage requires a comparatively larger increase in treatment coverage in order for hospitalization and mortality levels to remain unchanged. Conclusions Adopting universal vaccination and universal treatment goals in the United States will likely lead to a COVID-19 mortality burden below 50,000 deaths per year, a burden comparable to that of influenza virus.

However, at the time of writing, access to vaccines that prevent life-threatening infectious diseases remains unequal to all infants, children and adults in the world. This is a problem that many individuals and agencies are working hard to address globally. As clinicians and biomedical scientists we often focus on the health benefits that vaccines provide, in the prevention of ill-health and death from infectious pathogens. Here we discuss the health, economic and social benefits of vaccines that have been identified and studied in recent years, impacting all regions and all age groups. After learning of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in December 2019, and its potential for global dissemination to cause COVID-19 disease was realized, there was an urgent need to develop vaccines at an unprecedented rate and scale. As we appreciate and quantify the health, economic and social benefits of vaccines and immunization programs to individuals and society, we should endeavor to communicate this to the public and policy makers, for the benefit of endemic, epidemic, and pandemic diseases.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The COVID-19 pandemic has once again exposed deficiencies in existing global health systems, emergency management, and disease surveillance, and highlighted the importance of developing effective evaluation tools. This article outlines current challenges emerging from infectious disease control from the perspective of global health, elucidated through influenza, malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases. The discordance among government actors and absent data sharing platforms or tools has led to unfulfilled targets in health system resilience and a capacity gap in infectious disease response. The current situation calls for urgent action to tackle these threats of global infectious diseases with joined forces through more in-depth international cooperation and breaking governance barriers from the purview of global health. Overall, a systematic redesign should be considered to enhance the resilience of health systems, which warrants a great need to sustain capacity-building efforts in emergency preparedness and response and raises an emerging concern of data integration in the concept of One Health that aims to address shared health threats at the human-animal-environment interface.},

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis, Joanna Briggs, Global Health, and World Health Organization COVID-19 database (preprints). Eligibility criteria for study selection Observational and interventional studies that assessed the effectiveness of public health measures in reducing the incidence of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19 mortality. Main outcome measures The main outcome measure was incidence of covid-19. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 transmission and covid-19 mortality. Data synthesis DerSimonian Laird random effects meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effect of mask wearing, handwashing, and physical distancing measures on incidence of covid-19. Pooled effect estimates with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals were computed, and heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Cochran’s Q test and the I2 metrics, with two tailed P values. Results 72 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 35 evaluated individual public health measures and 37 assessed multiple public health measures as a “package of interventions.” Eight of 35 studies were included in the meta-analysis, which indicated a reduction in incidence of covid-19 associated with handwashing (relative risk 0.47, 95\% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.12, I2=12\%), mask wearing (0.47, 0.29 to 0.75, I2=84\%), and physical distancing (0.75, 0.59 to 0.95, I2=87\%). Owing to heterogeneity of the studies, meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of quarantine and isolation, universal lockdowns, and closures of borders, schools, and workplaces. The effects of these interventions were synthesised descriptively. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that several personal protective and social measures, including handwashing, mask wearing, and physical distancing are associated with reductions in the incidence covid-19. Public health efforts to implement public health measures should consider community health and sociocultural needs, and future research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of public health measures in the context of covid-19 vaccination.

  abstract = {By reviewing the literature on the development of English language teaching methods in the last three decades, it is obvious that the idea of using the first language (L1) in the second language (L2) classroom has always been controversial. The history of language pedagogy and the role of the first language in foreign language learning generate debates in English as a foreign language. The teaching of English as a foreign language is growing every day in Iran, and as a result, the need for informing the best policy is getting more urgent. The principal intent of the current study, that investigates the use of L1 in the English classroom, is to determine teachers, students and policymakers' beliefs and attitudes towards the use of L1 in L2 classroom. The L1, in this case, is Farsi language and all the participants are native speakers of Farsi. One hundred and fifty students of the English Language Department at the elementary level at Tehran Institute of Technology are the participants of the study. They are all female and in their late teens or early twenties. The students and the teachers were surveyed by questionnaires and the researcher observed 10 classes and interviewed 3 teachers and 3 policymakers. The information gathered from the questionnaire was submitted to SPSS for analyzing the data, and the information gathered from the interview. Class observation check-list was used to triangulate the findings of the questionnaire. The results of this study indicate that teachers and students have different attitudes towards using L1 in the EFL classes. While students have a positive attitude, teachers have a negative attitude. The main reason mentioned by students for not being against the limited use of Farsi in their English class is that they believe using Farsi even in a limited sense can help them to understand difficult concepts. However, teachers believe in an English-only policy to be more exposed to the English language. Another finding of this study is that the functions of using Farsi by students or teachers in EFL classroom are: for explaining difficult parts, for managing the classroom, for explaining exam instructions, for explaining the two language differences, for checking comprehension, for seeking help from others, for joking with others, for making students relaxed and for presenting the meaning of new words. Given these findings, to match the student's and teachers'/policymakers' ideas about using L1 at the elementary level, an EFL teaching methodology that considers the use of Farsi, even in a limited way, is suggested.},

Note-taking did not directly affect recall, but students performed better using their preferred note-taking method. Stylus and longhand note-taking conferred advantages in course grades and were associated with higher perceived recall and engagement. Although there may be advantages to longhand and stylus note-taking, it is important to allow flexibility for student note-taking preferences.},

  abstract = {Strategic note-taking is beneficial to students in that it provides a certain way a student can learn, and it can help a student perform better in courses. Taking strategic notes is seen as an important skill that is needed in a college setting. Strategic note-taking involves active listening, processing information, and writing. It is hypothesized that a student's strategic and extensive note-taking can yield a higher performance and achievement. Proper note-taking is a skill that many college students lack. The objective of this research study is to examine whether strategic-note taking improves science, engineering, and mathematics students' performance, achievement, and learning. A survey research was done and collected from 160 students of the City College of New York. The survey questionnaire included Likert-type and open-ended questions, which served to understand the students' views, perceptions, and beliefs about the benefits of strategic note-taking. Data collected from this research project show that note-taking improves students' recall of material, increases students' understanding of the content, assists in preparation for examinations, and improves their overall grades. Note-taking plays a role in gaining knowledge, learning and success in courses. Also, it is noteworthy that our data show a correlation between note-taking and grade point average (GPA); students who take better notes have higher GPAs.},

  abstract = {Background: Note-taking is an integral component of professional nursing practice. If students are to complete this effectively, a range of teaching, learning and assessment strategies are required to support their development of this skill. Objectives: This study aimed to identify lecturers' perspectives of students' note-taking on placement to identify factors that limit the development of this skill; these perspectives could be used to explore strategies to support students to develop this skill while at university. Design: A qualitative study taking a phenomenological approach was carried out. Participants: Three senior nursing practice visitors agreed to be interviewed. Methods: Semistructured interviews were carried out and thematic analysis carried out to explore lecturers' perspectives of students' experiences of note-taking while on placement. These interviews were intended to obtain detailed accounts of note-taking and allow challenges to be explored. Results: Each participant observed and supported students' note-taking within practice placement settings. Three main themes emerged from the data: limitations to students' vocabulary and literacy; inconsistency between trusts resulting in an inability to articulate experience; and note-taking clarity and accuracy. Conclusion: Note-taking is central to nurses' education and professional documentation to support best practice and high-quality patient care. Variations in processes between trusts, stringency of standards required by the trusts where students attend placements, and students' writing abilities differ widely, which directly affect the consistency and accuracy of written notes.},

Any note can potentially be used as an Intermediate Packet in some larger project or goal.” (Forte, 2022, p. 134)

  abstract = {Air pollution is an environmental and a social problem which leads to a multitude of adverse effects on human health and standard of human life, state of the ecosystems and global change of climate. Air pollutants are emitted from natural, but mostly from anthropogenic sources and may be transported over long distances. Some air pollutants are extremely stable in the atmosphere and may accumulate in the environment and in the food chain, affecting human beings, animals and natural biodiversity. Obviously, air pollution is a complex problem that poses multiple challenges in terms of management and abatements of the pollutants emission. Effective approach to the problems of air pollution requires a good understanding of the sources that cause it, knowledge of air quality status and future trends as well as its impact on humans and ecosystems. This chapter deals with the complexities of the air pollution and presents an overview of different technical processes and equipment for air pollution control, as well as basic principles of their work. The problems of air protection as well as protection of other ecosystems can be solved only by the coordinated endeavors of various scientific and engineering disciplines, such as chemistry, physics, biology, medicine, chemical engineering and social sciences. The most important engineering contribution is mostly focused on development, design and operation of equipment for the abatement of harmful emissions into environment.},

Projected population increases in urban areas over the coming decades underscore the importance of understanding the sources, variations, and impacts of air pollution. While some megacities experience episodic extreme events, in others, extremely degraded air quality is chronic. In this review, we assess recent findings on the impacts of extreme air pollution, which we define as concentrations exceeding international guidelines. We highlight recent research on pollution and growth trends in the most populous megacities. We then emphasize important new methods for monitoring air pollution exposure, such as satellite-based estimates, and suggest future needs, including a more comprehensive understanding of the health and economic impacts. The primary conclusion to emerge is that, globally, while the extreme air pollution burden is highest in megacities in developing countries, significant gaps remain in our understanding.},

Design/methodology/approach This normative legal study used secondary data comprising primary and secondary legal materials based on the law as a norm. The normative legal method was used because the data were based on laws and regulations, reports, journals and research governing telemedicine in Indonesia and the USA. Findings The results showed similarities between Indonesia and the USA regarding health services as part of protecting human rights. The differences in implementing telemedicine are from a legal aspect. The legal comparison of telemedicine implementation between the two countries resulted in differences in regulation, informed consent, medical records, practice licenses and medical prescriptions. Research limitations/implications This study discussed telemedicine’s legal aspects in Indonesia and the USA. Practical implications This study aimed to determine the implementation and guidelines used by the USA to be considered for adoption by Indonesia for legal certainty. Social implications The results showed that legal threats could be a weakness of law in Indonesia. Therefore, the government should develop guidelines about telemedicine to accommodate citizens’ legal protection and certainty. Originality/value This study is original and could be used as a reference for policymakers in Indonesia and the USA in protecting citizens using telemedicine services. The findings provide a perspective based on Health Law in Indonesia.},

  abstract = {Sustainability has gained importance in the building design/construction industry due to the increase in the need for energy, the extensive use of non-renewable resources, and therefore the damage caused to the environment by traditional building design and construction. The concept of green building was developed for this reason. Green buildings can be defined as structures that consume less water, energy, and other resources while emphasizing human health and protecting the environment. While green buildings have these advantages over traditional buildings, the rate of green building production is less than expected because many barriers are encountered during the design and production of green buildings, despite the recent attention paid to sustainable practices. This research focuses on exploring the barriers encountered during green building production in Turkiye and the possible solutions for overcoming these barriers. According to the data obtained through a questionnaire survey, the most important difficulties encountered in Turkiye include the lack of government subsidies, the lack of green building regulations, the public’s indifference to green building technologies, and education and technology deficiencies. According to the respondents, the possible solutions involve government incentives, adoption of national standards and best practices, educating the public and the design/construction professionals about green buildings, and the development of novel green building technologies. The major contribution of the findings is that it highlights the fact that the stakeholders of green building projects (i.e., owners, designers, constructors, and facility managers) face important barriers and lets stakeholders recognize that solutions to overcome these barriers are available. The major implication is that the stakeholders in green building projects will likely be better prepared to deal with any barrier before undertaking green building projects in Turkiye and countries with similar socio-economic conditions.},

  abstract = {Green buildings play a crucial role in sustainable development by reducing energy consumption, minimizing environmental impact, and enhancing occupant health and well-being. This review explores the role of policy and regulation in promoting green buildings, highlighting the importance of government intervention in driving sustainable building practices. Government policies and regulations play a pivotal role in shaping the adoption of green building practices. Through a combination of mandates, incentives, and standards, governments can encourage the construction and renovation of buildings that prioritize energy efficiency, water conservation, and environmental sustainability. Mandatory building codes and standards are among the most effective tools governments use to promote green buildings. These codes set minimum requirements for energy performance, water efficiency, and indoor environmental quality, ensuring that new constructions and major renovations meet established sustainability criteria. In addition to mandatory standards, governments also use financial incentives to encourage green building practices. These incentives may include tax credits, grants, or subsidies for building owners and developers who incorporate sustainable design features or achieve green building certifications. Furthermore, governments can influence the market through procurement policies that prioritize green buildings for public projects. By leading by example, governments can create a ripple effect in the private sector, encouraging more developers and building owners to embrace sustainable building practices. Overall, the role of policy and regulation in promoting green buildings is essential for advancing sustainable development goals. By setting clear standards, providing incentives, and leading by example, governments can create an environment where green buildings are the norm rather than the exception, leading to a more sustainable built environment for future generations.},

The Buildings-GSR reviews the status of policies, finance, technologies and solutions to monitor whether the sector is aligned with the Paris Agreement goals. It also provides stakeholders with evidence to persuade policymakers and the overall buildings and construction community to take action. As outlined in this edition, the buildings and construction sector contributes significantly to global climate change, accounting for about 21 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. In 2022, buildings were responsible for 34 per cent of global energy demand and 37 per cent of energy and process-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The 2022 update of the Global Buildings Climate Tracker (GBCT) paints a concerning picture: the gap between the current state and the desired decarbonization path is significant. To align with the 2030 milestone, an annual increase of ten decarbonization points is now required, a substantial jump from the six points anticipated per year starting in 2015. This year, the deep dive chapters are the following: adaptation and resilient construction methods; innovations in business cases, as well as nature-based solutions and biophilic design.},

  abstract = {(1) Background: The decoupling of energy consumption from economic growth in the construction industry is crucial to the sustainable development of the global construction industry. The existing studies focus on the advancements in energy efficiency by designers for building monoliths or construction techniques, involving no exploration of energy efficiency management from a regional perspective, which is unfavorable for the formulation of energy efficiency policies and systematic control of the construction industry by local governments. (2) Methods: From the perspective of regional management, this paper constructs an integrated analysis and application framework of “spatio-temporal characteristics + matching evaluation + policy design” based on the decoupling model and GIS tools. It studies the spatio-temporal characteristics of energy consumption in the construction industry in 30 provinces of China from 2010 to 2019, and its decoupling relationship with the economic development of the construction industry, and proposes an optimal zoning and recommendations for energy consumption in the construction industry, providing a reference for energy conservation management in the construction industry in China. (3) Results: First, the change of energy consumption amount (ECA) in the construction industry in the provinces was dominated by ascent, while the energy consumption intensity (ECI) predominantly decreased, and most provinces are still in a period of growth or plateau in energy consumption. Second, ECA and ECI had prominent spatial heterogeneity and aggregation. High-energy-consuming regions are concentrated along the coast and along the Yangtze River, while low-energy-consuming regions are mainly clustered in remote areas, such as the northeast, northwest, and southwest of China. Energy consumption shows a clear north-south difference in intensity, with high-intensity regions clustered in the north compared to low-intensity regions in the south. Third, most of the provinces were in strong negative decoupling, expansive coupling, and weak decoupling, and better decoupling regions were mainly gathered in south and central China. Nearly one half of these provinces showed decoupling degradation and only a few achieved evolution, with evolutionary regions clustered mainly in central and southern China. The northeast and northwest were the key problem areas of energy-saving transformation in China’s construction industry. (4) Conclusion: The 30 provinces were divided into three types: leader, intermediate, and laggard, and the development goals and suggestions on low energy consumption in the construction industry for three zones were put forward, significantly improving the precision of policy design and implementation. The study in this paper expands the research perspective on energy saving management in the construction industry and provides a methodology and basis for developing energy efficiency policies and plans for the construction industry in China and similar developing countries.},

  abstract = {Global industrialization and excessive dependence on nonrenewable energy sources have led to an increase in solid waste and climate change, calling for strategies to implement a circular economy in all sectors to reduce carbon emissions by 45\% by 2030, and to~achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Here we review circular economy strategies with focus on waste management, climate change, energy, air and water quality, land use, industry, food production, life cycle assessment, and cost-effective routes. We observed that increasing the use of bio-based materials is a challenge in terms of land use and land cover. Carbon removal technologies are actually prohibitively expensive, ranging from 100 to 1200 dollars per ton of carbon dioxide. Politically, only few companies worldwide have set climate change goals. While circular economy strategies can be implemented in various sectors such as industry, waste, energy, buildings, and transportation, life cycle assessment is required to optimize new systems. Overall, we provide a theoretical foundation for a sustainable industrial, agricultural, and commercial future by constructing cost-effective routes to a circular economy.},

  abstract = {Climate change is a major threat already causing system damage to urban and natural systems, and inducing global economic losses of over \$500 billion. These issues may be partly solved by artificial intelligence because artificial intelligence integrates internet resources to make prompt suggestions based on accurate climate change predictions. Here we review recent research and applications of artificial intelligence in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change, with a~focus on energy efficiency, carbon sequestration and storage, weather and renewable energy forecasting, grid management, building design, transportation, precision agriculture, industrial processes, reducing deforestation, and resilient cities. We found that enhancing energy efficiency can significantly contribute to reducing the impact of climate change. Smart manufacturing can reduce energy consumption, waste, and carbon emissions by 30–50\% and, in particular, can reduce energy consumption in buildings by 30–50\%. About 70\% of the global natural gas industry utilizes artificial intelligence technologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasts. Combining smart grids with artificial intelligence can optimize the efficiency of power systems, thereby reducing electricity bills by 10–20\%. Intelligent transportation systems can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 60\%. Moreover, the management of natural resources and the design of resilient cities through the application of artificial intelligence can further promote sustainability.},

  abstract = {Nature-based Solutions (NBS) are increasingly promoted to support sustainable and resilient urban planning. However, design and planning urban NBS targeted at the needs of the local context require knowledge about the causal relationships between NBS, ecosystem services (ES) and urban challenges (UC) This paper aims at contributing to this knowledge, by systematically identifying nexuses (i.e. qualitative links) between UC, ES and NBS, and describing plausible causal relationships. A conceptual UC-ES-NBS criteria framework was built, and used to guide a two-step systematic literature review on current UC and on the supply of ES by urban NBS. This was followed by a non-systematic literature review, which complemented the previous one by unveiling knowledge gaps on the biophysical and social processes and attributes on which specific ES classes depend. The non-systematic review was also used to identify additional NBS. The UC review identified 18 UC and 58 sub-challenges, and illustrated which UC were more studied, according to the type of literature and environmental and socio-economic attributes of urban contexts. The ES review led to the development of an urban NBS classification, and supported the identification of UC-ES and ES-NBS nexuses, which were analysed and classified into four groups of causal relationship. For the nexuses identified as direct plausible causal relationship, the main processes and attributes on which the supply of specific ES depend were pointed out. Relationships between UC, ES, NBS, processes, and attributes were represented in the form of network diagrams. Our results can be used to support urban policies aimed at mainstreaming NBS and as a basis to further understand UC-ES-NBS relationships.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Narratives are special in several ways-they tend to be expressed, or controlled by a single speaker. They are usually spoken in external terms and have a special organisation. Narratives are a type of discourse in which people describe a series of events from an actual or fictional world in the past (Labov \& Waletzky 1967). In conversation they are common in the form of stories, jokes and anecdotes. Effective communication and narrative abilities are now crucial for people in every aspect of life in the modern, rapidly changing world. The ability to create engaging and convincing narratives that attract people, convey ideas, and motivate action is one of the skills that holds a distinct position. The power of a narrative is acknowledged as a strong tool for engrossing and connecting with others, whether it be in literature, marketing, teaching, or even scientific inquiry. In this study 15 children were chosen, between the ages of 5-10 years. The current study's objective is to examine how media and technology affect children's narrative abilities between the age range of 5 -10 years with an emphasis on the fields of audiology and speech-language pathology. The results revealed that children in both the groups in the age range of 5-10 years didn’t exhibit any significant difference in their narrative skills.},

By conducting a thorough literature review of recent research and studies, this review identifies key areas of concern and recommends best practices for parents and educators.  The findings of the review suggest that excessive use of technology can have detrimental effects on a child’s physical health, social skills, academic performance, and mental well-being. However, when used appropriately, technology can provide valuable opportunities for learning, socialization, and entertainment. The review presents several examples of best practices, including setting boundaries on screen time, encouraging outdoor play and physical activity, fostering social interaction, and modeling healthy technology use behaviors.  Given the fast pace of technological development and its increasing prevalence in daily life, it is more important than ever for parents and educators to prioritize moderation and digital detoxification practices in children’s routines. By adopting a proactive approach to technology use and emphasizing healthy technology habits, we can promote positive behavior and encourage children to develop balanced and responsible relationships with technology. Overall, this review underscores the need for parents and educators to understand the impacts of technology on children’s behavior and take effective actions to cultivate healthy habits.},

The aim of this study was to examine the impact of eye-gaze assistive technology intervention on participation in computer activities and technology usability among children with complex needs in Taiwan. This study involved a multiple baseline design across individuals. The participants were four children aged three to six years with severe motor and communication difficulties and low eye-control skills. The six-month intervention consisted of two collaborative team meetings and 12 individual supports to facilitate the use of eye-gaze assistive technology at home or in educational environments. Participation in computer activities (diversity, frequency, and duration) was repeatedly measured through a computer use diary. Other outcomes included assessments of goal achievements and parents/teachers’ ratings on children’s performance in computer activities. The young children increased the diversity of their computer activities and their frequency and duration of computer use from baseline to the intervention phase. The children attained six of eight predefined goals related to play, communication, and school learning. Parents and teachers perceived the children’s changes in performance as meaningful. This study strengthens the evidence that eye-gaze assistive technology is useful in everyday contexts for children with complex needs in Taiwan. The findings add knowledge that children with weak eye-control skills increased participation in computer activities as a result of the eye-gaze assistive technology. Implications for RehabilitationEye-gaze assistive technology (EGAT) as an access method to control a computer can provide opportunities for children with severe motor and communication difficulties to participate in computer activities.Children with severe motor and communication difficulties and low eye-control skills with sufficient practice can learn to use EGAT for communication and learning, with support from stakeholders and collaborative service.EGAT could be introduced for children with complex needs at early ages as a means of using computers for play, communication, and school learning, which could be helpful for later education and learning.Stakeholders in educational environments could include EGAT in educational computer systems so that pupils with severe motor and communication difficulties could interact with a computer, thereby enhancing their engagement and learning.

  abstract = {If you have not already noticed, living walls (green walls) are on the up. It is the latest growing trend in horticulture and architects, designers, building owners and tenants are already embracing this new planting method to help them green up their living and working environments, especially where horizontal space is of a premium or even completely unavailable.  Thanks to Marion :)) The Rubens at the Palace Hotel living wall, on the doorstep of Buckingham Palace. The wall’s unique design enables it to capture rainwater from the roof of the building in dedicated storage tanks. A key environmental challenge in Victoria is the risk of flooding during periods of heavy rain, due to the low absorbency of urban surfaces. According to the Environment Agency, there are now around 534,000 properties in London on the Thames floodplain, and one in four in London are at risk of flooding. Water collected by the tanks is channelled slowly through the wall, nourishing plant life and helping to reduce the risk of surface water flooding in the area by storing up to 10,000 litres at any time. The project has received support from the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, through his Greening the BIDs programme (co-ordinated by the regeneration agency Cross River Partnership). In addition, the wall will improve the air quality in the area, deaden noise and help to keep the hotel cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. The vegetation can trap microscopic pollutants known as particulate matter (PM10s), high levels of which have been shown to cause respiratory illnesses. The wall was designed by Gary Grant of the Green Roof Consultancy},
