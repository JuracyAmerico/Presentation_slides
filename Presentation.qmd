::: notes
**Let's start by considering the bigger picture**. As we all know, the
global demand for energy is constantly growing. Couple this with the
urgent need to address climate change and it becomes clear that we need
to rethink our approach to energy consumption, especially in the
building sector.

**Why the building sector, you might ask?** The reason is that buildings
account for a substantial portion of global energy consumption and
greenhouse gas emissions. This is where renewable energy sources come
in, offering a viable pathway to reduce the carbon footprint of
buildings and create a more sustainable future.

::: notes
**Now, let's shift our attention to the heart of the matter: the
challenges we need to overcome.** Despite the promise of renewable
energy, its widespread adoption in buildings faces several obstacles.
**These barriers include**:

-   **High upfront costs:** The initial investment required for
    renewable energy systems can be a deterrent for many building
    owners.
-   **Technological limitations**: While promising, some technologies
    are still under development and may not yet be efficient or
    cost-effective for all types of buildings.
-   **Lack of public awareness:** Many people are simply not aware of
    the benefits of renewable energy or the options available to them.
-   **Policy and regulatory inconsistencies**: A lack of clear,
    consistent policies and regulations can create uncertainty for
    investors and hinder the growth of the renewable energy market in
    the building sector.

**With these challenges in mind, let's explore some potential
solutions.**

::: notes
**First**, let's talk about the role of government policy.

-   Governments can play a significant role in promoting renewable
    energy use in buildings by implementing supportive policies.
-   This could include:
    -   Mandatory building energy codes that set minimum standards for
        energy efficiency and encourage renewable energy integration.

    -   Financial incentives such as tax credits, grants, and subsidies
        to make renewable energy systems more financially attractive.

    -   Programs to support capacity development and training for
        industry professionals on the design, installation, and
        maintenance of renewable energy systems.

:::
:::
:::
:::

::: notes
**In addition to these measures, several specific policy instruments
have proven effective in promoting renewable energy adoption**.

-   **Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)**: These policies require
    utilities to generate a certain percentage of their electricity from
    renewable sources.
-   **Renewable Energy Standards (RES)**: Similar to RPS, RES policies
    mandate a certain percentage of energy consumption to come from
    renewables.
-   **Feed-in tariffs:** These policies offer long-term contracts to
    renewable energy producers, guaranteeing a fixed price for the
    electricity they feed into the grid.

**Moving on to our second key area, innovation**, technological
advancements are essential to improve the efficiency, affordability, and
accessibility of renewable energy systems.

-   Continued research and development of innovative renewable energy
    technologies are crucial for wider adoption in the building sector.
-   This includes:
    -   Further development of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV)
        that seamlessly incorporate solar panels into building designs.
    -   Advancements in solar thermal technologies that use sunlight to
        heat water and air for buildings.
    -   Exploration of geothermal energy, utilizing the earth's heat for
        heating and cooling purposes.
    -   Development of micro-wind turbines that can generate electricity
        from wind in urban environments.

::: notes
**Another area where innovation is key is in energy storage**. Improved
energy storage solutions can address one of the main challenges with
renewable energy: its intermittency. By storing excess energy generated
during periods of high production, we can ensure a consistent and
reliable energy supply even when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't
blowing.

::: notes
**Now that we've explored both policy and innovation, let's take a
moment to evaluate these solutions.**

**Policy-driven approaches can be highly effective**. By creating a
supportive policy environment, governments can incentivize the adoption
of renewable energy, attract investment, and drive market
transformation.

-   **However**, there are also potential drawbacks.
    -   Policy inconsistencies, lack of enforcement, and changes in
        government priorities can undermine the effectiveness of these
        measures.

**Technology-driven solutions offer the promise of increased efficiency,
reduced costs over time, and the potential for breakthroughs that can
revolutionize the way we power our buildings**.

-   **However,** these solutions are not without challenges.
    -   High upfront costs, the need for specialized expertise, and the
        risk of technological obsolescence are factors that need to be
        carefully considered.
